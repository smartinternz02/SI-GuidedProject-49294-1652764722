Flight Delays Prediction Using IBM Cloud

Hi, This is Madhumitha R (20BCE1912) from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. I attened the SmartInternz Externship Program on Applied Data Science. I gained hands-on experience on python, data science, machine learning and IBM Cloud. With these learnings, I built a project titled "Flight Delays Prediction Using IBM Cloud". The aim of this project is to predict flight delays accurately in order to optimise flight operations and minimum the delays. For this we use machine learning models such as decision tree classifiers to predict the arrival time.
The repository for the same is added here. 

File Names is as follows :

The file names:

flightdelay.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)

flightdata.csv (Dataset)

flight.pkl (pickle module file)

app.py (Flask Application to run the application locally)

index.html (Webpage)

IBM_flightdelay.ipynb (Notebook in IBM Cloud)

ibm_app.py (Flask Application to run the application through IBM Cloud)

Flight Delay Prediction Report.pdf ( Project Report)
